# Multi-Agent Systems - Solution Guide

## Introduction

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) consist of multiple autonomous agents, each with distinct goals, behaviors, and areas of responsibility. These agents can interact with each other, either cooperating or competing, depending on the objectives they are designed to achieve. In MAS, each agent operates independently, making decisions based on its local knowledge and the environment, but they can communicate and share information to solve complex problems collectively.

MAS is often used in scenarios where tasks are distributed across different entities, and the overall system benefits from decentralization. Examples include simulations of real-world systems like traffic management, robotic teams, distributed AI applications, or networked systems where agents need to coordinate actions without a central controller. MAS allows for flexibility, scalability, and adaptability in solving dynamic and complex problems where a single agent or centralized system might be less efficient or incapable of handling the complexity on its own.

In this challenge, you will create a multi-agent system that takes the user's request and feeds it to a collection of agents. Each agent will have its own persona and responsibility. The final response will be a collection of answers from all agents that together will satisfy the user's request based on each persona's area of expertise.

    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=Replace with your API key
    ```
   ![](./Images/Image13a.png)

## Task 2 - Create a GitHub Repository and Generate a PAT Token

1. Sign in to GitHub at [https://github.com](https://github.com).  

1. Create a New Repository with the name `Capstone-Project-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>` **(1)**. Let the repo be set to **Public (2)** and click on **Create Repository (3)**.

   ![](./Images/Image16.png)

2. Click your profile picture at the top-right corner and select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.  

   ![](./Images/Image.png)

4. In the left sidebar, click **Developer settings**.  
5. Click **Personal access tokens**.  
6. Click **Tokens (classic)**.  
7. Click **Generate new token (classic)**.  
8. Enter a name for your token (e.g., `MyToken`).  
9. Set an expiration date for the token.  
10. Select the required scopes (e.g., check `repo` and `workflow`).  
11. Scroll down and click **Generate token**.  
12. Copy the generated token now. You wonâ€™t see it again.

## Important

- Use this token instead of your password when authenticating GitHub.  
- Keep your token safe and do not share it.  
- Revoke the token immediately if you suspect it is compromised.
